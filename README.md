## Hi there my is Ethan ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on a DNS-resolver project and planning a potential fighting game project\
I'm learning more skills in C++ and Python as well as starting on SQL\
I'm hoping to start a Key-Logging project once I am done with my current project\
<br/>
A main goal of mine is to be able to get a better grasp on cyber security; primarily to learn about and how to combat malware\
